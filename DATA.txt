A year has four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. There is a big elephant and a crocodile, several monkeys and a lion. I want to see a snake and a giraffe there. We will go there on the weekend. I will see bears, penguins, horses, squirrels, foxes and rabbits. I will enjoy our family holiday.Long, long ago there lived a young and very beautiful girl called Cinderella.Cinderella lived with her stepmother and stepsisters. The sisters were wicked and haughty. They were jealous of Cinderellas beauty and treated her as a servant. Every week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
